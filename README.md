Codealingo is a fullstack Next js app based around learning programming languages in the form of lessons broken down into units.​

You can join our courses and undertake lessons whenever you deem fit in languages such as CSS,HTML AND JS, with many more to come such as languages from the C family, some lesser known ones like rust, and perhaps some more familiar languages such as typescript or SQL. ​


Codealingo was built with a variety of tools & technologies that helped us along the way, whether with planning, organising or the actual build itself​.
